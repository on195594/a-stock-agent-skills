# Operations runbook

This runbook covers the installed runtime after the M7 cutover. Claude, Codex
and Hermes remain supported clients. Nothing here authorizes investment
decisions or unattended W1 writes.

## Configuration and state

The runtime resolves settings in this order: explicit environment variable,
`A_STOCK_CONFIG_FILE` (or the default XDG config file), then XDG defaults.
The config file must be user-owned and mode `0600`:

```text
~/.config/a-stock-agent/runtime.env
~/.local/share/a-stock-agent/cache.db
~/.local/share/a-stock-agent/logs/
~/.local/share/a-stock-agent/locks/
~/.local/share/a-stock-agent/artifacts/
```

The production config contains the state paths and notification mode. Keep
Telegram credentials in that external file or the existing secret store; do
not copy them into this repository or evidence.

## Routine checks

Use the stable commands from any working directory:

```bash
a-stock-cache holdings
a-stock-cache portfolio-risk
a-stock-cache check-holdings
a-stock-fetch check <代码>
```

`holdings` and `portfolio-risk` are read-only views. `check-holdings` is an
R1 routine check: it may refresh market data and record an alert, but it does
not write holdings, transactions or other W1 investment state.

For a cron-equivalent smoke, disable notifications and point at the external
config explicitly:

```bash
A_STOCK_CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/.config/a-stock-agent/runtime.env" \
A_STOCK_NOTIFY_MODE=disabled \
  bash scripts/check-holdings-cron.sh
```

## S1 risk closure candidate (not deployed)

`monitor-snapshot --json` and `portfolio-risk` accept the same optional
`--portfolio-value`, `--max-position-risk-pct` and `--max-portfolio-risk-pct`.
Absent overrides, limits remain 2% / 8%, explicitly marked unconfirmed
compatibility defaults. The report displays the effective source; models must
not invent overrides to bypass a breach. Missing total assets or risk inputs
cannot establish budget compliance. A known breach remains visible even if
another holding is unpriced; complete total risk remains unavailable.

Budget review is read-only. It does not sell, change stops, persist alerts or
block recording a user-confirmed broker execution under existing W1 rules.
The `risk_budget_exceeded` reason requires the matching monitor-v1 validator,
CLI and Skill release set; see [runtime contracts](architecture/runtime-contracts.md).

S1 work is isolated from the active Skill symlinks. Do not pull the new source
into that active working tree as an implicit deployment. Deploy only under a
separate authorization using a complete immutable release directory, after
client qualification and compatibility inventory. The old producer/consumer
pair can return clean despite a budget breach; rollback therefore requires
manual budget review or suspension of risk suggestions, not a claim of safety.
No S1 database migration, cron change or account-data cleanup is required.

## S3b file-only account performance candidate (not deployed)

```bash
a-stock-cache performance-report --input /private/external/account.json --json
a-stock-cache performance-report --input /private/external/account.json \
  --benchmark /private/external/benchmark.json
```

The input schemas and synthetic example are fixed by [spec §8.3–8.5](specs/2026-09-17-a-stock-risk-closure-and-performance-validation-spec-v1.1.md).
Keep real source files in a protected directory outside Git; do not mix accounts.
The command reads files and emits stdout (text by default, JSON with `--json`);
it neither reconstructs account equity from holdings nor saves/imports facts.
Without `--check-ledger`, dispatch does not resolve a database path or enter a
DB handler. No network, notification, database creation, migration or output-file
write is performed. Source files are not corrected or modified.

Amounts are Decimal strings. Returns remove only permitted external flows;
broker equity already includes investment income, fees and corporate actions.
Unknown/intraday flow timing breaks the chain. `end_assumed` requires the explicit
`--allow-eod-flow-assumption` flag and remains estimated, even when source
reconciliation is also provisional. Withdrawal-to-zero is not total loss;
a positive balance after zero establishes a new baseline. Missing dates/intervals
are never bridged into a full-period return or drawdown. No calendar means
observed-only drawdown, not complete daily-close or intraday coverage.

Optional benchmark NAV supports more than two decimal places. Invalid JSON,
null/schema/currency/date/effectivity gaps preserve the absolute report but
suppress comparison. Price-return references are explicitly distinguished from
total-return references; neither implies an executable alternative was evaluated.
`null_reasons` explains unavailable segment metrics; unrequested benchmark is not
an error. Baseline-only input has no measurable return interval (exit 4).

`--check-ledger` is a deliberately limited read-only diagnostic: missing database,
missing history/schema or inferred records are disclosed. Without verifiable
account mapping, row counts are **not** account reconciliation; the report stays
limited/provisional and does not invent cash flows or write back to holdings.

Exit codes: 0 usable requested calculation; 2 invalid account/schema/arguments;
4 a parsed business report with gaps (including requested unusable benchmark or
ledger evidence); 1 unexpected runtime/I/O failure. `exact` is conditional on the
file's source declarations and flow model, not independent broker authentication,
GIPS compliance, causal AI attribution or trading permission.

## S3a read-only risk policy candidate (not deployed)

Both risk commands additionally accept `--policy-file`, `--account-scope` and
`--portfolio-value-as-of`. A shared resolver applies explicit numeric overrides,
then a selected effective/confirmed file, then the unconfirmed 2%/8% defaults.
A numeric override never suppresses an invalid selected file. It is not permission
for a model to alter a user's policy or to record a trade.

Policy path selection is CLI → `A_STOCK_RISK_POLICY_FILE` in environment/runtime.env
→ `risk-policy.json` beside the selected runtime.env (the XDG config directory
by default). Only absence of an unconfigured default permits fallback. Files are
read-only, regular, current-user-owned and mode 0600 or stricter. No command
creates, updates or confirms a policy file. The exact schema is in
[spec §8.1](specs/2026-09-17-a-stock-risk-closure-and-performance-validation-spec-v1.1.md).
A file requires an explicit matching account scope and valid timezone-aware
confirmation/effectivity timestamps. Source/confirmation metadata is not a W1 token.

`account.portfolio_value_as_of` is the supplied asset valuation time, not snapshot
collection time. `denominator_freshness_status=as_of_provided` does not independently
prove freshness; no new TTL is imposed. Missing scope or as-of yields
`denominator_requires_review=true`: no authorization for new risk, even if the
existing-position budget report has a clean fast gate. No default 5% drawdown
limit or maximum-drawdown guarantee is introduced.

Invalid risk parameters return controlled failure before market/DB reads in the
handler. No real policy file has been created and no active client is upgraded.

## Write boundary

`set*`, alert/L3/Tier updates and holding or transaction commands are W1.
Invoke them only after the user confirms the concrete action and append the
global `--confirm-write` flag. Without it, the CLI exits `3` and does not open
a write transaction. A research or monitor report is a recommendation, not an
executed order.

## Cron and notifications

The candidate cron script loads external configuration, uses the stable
`a-stock-cache` command, takes a non-blocking lock and writes only to the
external log directory. `A_STOCK_NOTIFY_MODE=disabled` is the default for
tests and smoke runs. Telegram is enabled only by the production config and
only for a real or explicitly controlled verification event.

Do not install a second holdings cron entry. Before changing crontab, save the
complete current crontab, inspect the candidate diff, and verify that exactly
one canonical holdings task remains.

## Backup and rollback

For a state migration use `scripts/migrate_state.py`; it uses SQLite's Online
Backup API and records integrity, schema and count invariants. Never copy a
production database into the repository. The installer creates its rollback
manifest outside the repository; retain it with the external runtime backup.

If the new runtime has not written production state, rollback is:

1. stop the new cron;
2. restore the previous crontab and client links from the manifest;
3. point `CACHE_DB_PATH` back to the previous database;
4. run integrity and read-only smoke checks with notifications disabled.

If the new runtime has written state, stop all writers first. Do not simply
switch databases; export and reconcile the event/holding differences before
choosing a recovery path.

## Current deployment record

The current runtime is `v0.1.11` (`0.1.11-2c2d6018d411`, runtime source
commit `2c2d6018d4115fbea4dcdf214ce1786f50b478bf`) with the immutable
`a-stock-lib==0.7.0` release wheel (SHA-256
`7c4a16d452f34574584531bab6fe9d150f3cb844e5c9b2fe072295f6bb2ee385`).
Rollback manifest `rollback-1789186222598162920.json` preserves the prior
client Skill entries; runtime `0.1.11-75a3bee8068e` remains installed and
executable for CLI rollback. The repository HEAD may be newer because this
deployment record is committed after cutover.

The nine active client Skill entries and all three public CLI links resolve to
the current canonical/runtime targets. Package provenance, isolated imports,
CLI help, `pip check`, and installed-file hashes were verified. Production DB
and crontab hashes remained unchanged during the runtime-only cutover; no
holdings, W1 state, credentials, or production DB contents were read or written.

The original `v0.1.0` cutover record, redacted DB invariants, client links,
cron before/after snapshots and review disposition are in
[`migration/production-cutover/20260809-115052/`](migration/production-cutover/20260809-115052/).
