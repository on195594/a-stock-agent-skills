# Operations runbook

This runbook covers the installed runtime after the M7 cutover. Claude, Codex
and Hermes remain supported clients. Nothing here authorizes investment
decisions or unattended W1 writes.

## Configuration and state

The runtime resolves settings in this order: explicit environment variable,
`A_STOCK_CONFIG_FILE` (or the default XDG config file), then XDG defaults.
The config file must be user-owned and mode `0600`:

```text
~/.config/a-stock-agent/runtime.env
~/.local/share/a-stock-agent/cache.db
~/.local/share/a-stock-agent/logs/
~/.local/share/a-stock-agent/locks/
~/.local/share/a-stock-agent/artifacts/
```

The production config contains the state paths and notification mode. Keep
Telegram credentials in that external file or the existing secret store; do
not copy them into this repository or evidence.

## Routine checks

Use the stable commands from any working directory:

```bash
a-stock-cache holdings
a-stock-cache portfolio-risk
a-stock-cache check-holdings
a-stock-fetch check <代码>
```

`holdings` and `portfolio-risk` are read-only views. `check-holdings` is an
R1 routine check: it may refresh market data and record an alert, but it does
not write holdings, transactions or other W1 investment state.

For a cron-equivalent smoke, disable notifications and point at the external
config explicitly:

```bash
A_STOCK_CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/.config/a-stock-agent/runtime.env" \
A_STOCK_NOTIFY_MODE=disabled \
  bash scripts/check-holdings-cron.sh
```

## Write boundary

`set*`, alert/L3/Tier updates and holding or transaction commands are W1.
Invoke them only after the user confirms the concrete action and append the
global `--confirm-write` flag. Without it, the CLI exits `3` and does not open
a write transaction. A research or monitor report is a recommendation, not an
executed order.

## Cron and notifications

The candidate cron script loads external configuration, uses the stable
`a-stock-cache` command, takes a non-blocking lock and writes only to the
external log directory. `A_STOCK_NOTIFY_MODE=disabled` is the default for
tests and smoke runs. Telegram is enabled only by the production config and
only for a real or explicitly controlled verification event.

Do not install a second holdings cron entry. Before changing crontab, save the
complete current crontab, inspect the candidate diff, and verify that exactly
one canonical holdings task remains.

## Backup and rollback

For a state migration use `scripts/migrate_state.py`; it uses SQLite's Online
Backup API and records integrity, schema and count invariants. Never copy a
production database into the repository. The installer creates its rollback
manifest outside the repository; retain it with the external runtime backup.

If the new runtime has not written production state, rollback is:

1. stop the new cron;
2. restore the previous crontab and client links from the manifest;
3. point `CACHE_DB_PATH` back to the previous database;
4. run integrity and read-only smoke checks with notifications disabled.

If the new runtime has written state, stop all writers first. Do not simply
switch databases; export and reconcile the event/holding differences before
choosing a recovery path.

## Current deployment record

The current runtime is `v0.1.11` (`0.1.11-e1f5387ba2e2`, source commit
`e1f5387ba2e2e2f5f6c05872e1b6eedd1bed8389`) with `a-stock-lib==0.6.3`.
Rollback manifest `rollback-1788843078732695040.json` preserves the prior
client entries, and runtime `0.1.11-7131c119ae80` remains installed and
executable.

The nine active client Skill entries resolve to the canonical repository. The
production database passed `integrity_check`; its checksum was unchanged by
this runtime-only cutover. The systemd unit-file fingerprint was also
unchanged. Read-only production smoke checks confirmed five active holdings,
explicit account-value risk semantics, safe temporary semantics when account
value is omitted, and fail-closed behavior when the selected database is
missing.

The original `v0.1.0` cutover record, redacted DB invariants, client links,
cron before/after snapshots and review disposition are in
[`migration/production-cutover/20260809-115052/`](migration/production-cutover/20260809-115052/).
